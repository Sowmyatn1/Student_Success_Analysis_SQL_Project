# üéì Uncovering the Secrets of Student Success: A SQL Data Analysis Project
Data Analysis Projects using SQL

## üìä Overview
In the modern educational landscape, identifying what drives student performance is critical for academic success. Just like a city's transport system must adapt to its citizens, schools must tailor their approach to meet the diverse needs of students. This project dives into a dataset of student behaviors and performance metrics to uncover what factors truly impact academic achievement.

Using SQL, this analysis explores patterns in study habits, sleep duration, attendance, extracurricular activities, tutoring, and teacher quality to evaluate how each variable correlates with exam scores. The goal is to equip educators, students, and policy-makers with actionable insights that support data-driven decisions in the education system.

## üìÅ Dataset Description
The project uses a table named student_performance containing the following columns:
