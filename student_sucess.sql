/*Insight:
Students who studied more than 10 hours per week and participated in extracurricular activities tended to score significantly higher on exams.
 This suggests that involvement in activities outside the classroom may complement academic focus rather than hinder it.*/

Students studying 16+ hours per week scored the highest on average, followed by those in the 11â€“15 hour range.
 There is a clear positive correlation between time spent studying and exam performance.*/

Insight:
Top-ranking students not only studied more but also displayed high levels of attendance, had a balanced sleep routine, and attended tutoring sessions. 
This emphasizes a holistic approach to academic success involving consistency, support, and wellness.*/
